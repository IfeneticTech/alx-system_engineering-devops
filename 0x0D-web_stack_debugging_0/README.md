# Web stack debugging #0

This was the first project in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these
projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack to a perfect working state. For each
task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the
web stack problems.

## Task :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
